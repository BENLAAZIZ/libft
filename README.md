# libft

The primary aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive library featuring a wide range of functions essential for the 42 Cursus. These functions focus heavily on low-level operations, particularly memory management and allocationâ€”fundamental aspects of the C language. Additionally, mastering the construction and implementation of a Makefile is a central component of this project.





> [!NOTE]
Makefile is where you will create a file to compile your projects. Remember how in the piscine, you created an int main and gcc to compile the projects, well with a Makefile, you don't have to do that anymore, you just type make once you have created your Makefile.
